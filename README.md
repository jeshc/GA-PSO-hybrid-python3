## Implementation of a hybrid PSO-GA algorithm.

This repository is an implementation of the algorithm described in
the paper "Global Path Planning for Autonomous Robot Navigation Using
Hybrid Metaheuristic GA-PSO Algorithm" by Hsu-Chih Huang and Ching-Chih Tsai.


## Instructions
- If not already installed, install the [PyGame Library] (http://www.pygame.org/news.html)
- Place all the source files in the same directory.
- If under Windows OS:
    - Open `__main__.py` with IDLE and run it
- If under UNIX-like system:
    - Open a terminal
    - Move to the proper directory
    - Run the program with `python __main__.py`

#### TODO
- Allow the user to select the starting and goal position
- Allow the user to switch between other searching algorithms
